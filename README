RlzyCall

A really simple utility for android.

Displays a list of contacts, sends a Meteor "call-me" message to whomever you select.
This just makes things a little bit easier than the usual way of texting the recepients number to 50001

Based on droid 1.5 as that's what my HTC hero is running.

TODO:
Add support for selecting multiple contacts
Add support for removing selected contacts
Have the confirmation dialog confirm selected contacts
